* I does not work because if the customer buys more than 0 boxes, it would always print the maximum value.
   This can be fixed by putting an if else.
* II does works because it checks for the greatest number correctly and uses if else so the cost is only changed once. 
* III does not work because if the cost is more than 5 or 10, the code will still end on the first statement.
