# 2020 AP Practice Test

##MC

#### Score 17/40 (30 attempted)

#### Question 6
* I. turns 2 into a double and the rest of the operations into a double
* II. Solve 2/4 first then turns 0 into a double
* III. Solves the operations in () and then turns answer into a double

#### Question 8
* n1 and n2 only exits in the Points
* Have to use num1 and num2 since they are global variables
* Double values can be set equals to the integer values.

#### Question 9
* add() with array list will inset the value in the index.
* Everything after will be moved down.
* set() replaces the number in the specified index.

#### Question 11
* A. will print 10 and then subtract num
* In C. num is set to 10 and then is subtracted before printing
* 9 will be printed first, all the way to 1.

#### Question 12
* getName() function does not exist.
* Borrower is a variable which can be compared.
* Can directly compare to null.

#### Question 17
* Since j is initialized as a SuperHero object, the j.powerUp(10) method accessed is from the subclass.
* Subclass method uses super keyword with the parameter 20.
* Subclass adds p to original power value (50 + 2*10).

#### Question 19
* Nested for loop
* First element in each row is multiplied by two
* Sum of all the elements
* Keep track of variables when debugging 

#### Question 20
* Nested for loop goes through each book in array
* getpages() used to get number of pages for each book
* Compare it to max page value and switch if condition is met

#### Question 23
* Nested for each loop goes through every element in double array.
* When using nested for loop, don't need to use index number
* nested for loop references the element itself.

#### Question 24
* y is a static variable, it is linked with everything in the class
* When y is called, it increases by one
* Going through the methods, the y value ends up to be 14.

#### Question 31
* I. works because while loop goes through every i value and checks the condition correctly.
* II. does not work because it does not check the first value in the array. 
* III. does not work because for each loop goes through every number and num index. Using i as the index will return wrong values.

#### Question 33
* Debug through writing the variables of the loop down. 
* Row increases by one before going to the next line.
* F and j are part of the first column, so they will be printed on the top. 

#### Question 34
* As element of the array list get removed, the index of these values changes.
* Since i is always increasing by one, some elements are skipped.
* Can fix this code by checking array list backwards.

#### Question 35
* Check if the values are equal.
* Increase the counter if condition is met
* If the counter is bigger than the previous stored mode value, change it.

#### Question 36
* When a and b are both odd
* The body of the for loop in methodOne is executed a / b times. 
* The body of the while loop in methodTwo is executed a / b times only when a % b is equal to 0. 
* When a % b is not equal to 0, the body of the while loop in methodTwo is executed an additional time.

#### Question 39
* If the first character of str is lexicographically greater than the second character of str, the method returns the result of the recursive call with a parameter that contains all but the first character of str.
* If the first character of str is lexicographically less than or equal to the second character of str, the method returns false.
* If no such character pair is found, the base case is reached and the value true is returned.

#### Question 40
* At compile time, methods in or inherited by the declared type determine the correctness of a non-static method call. 
* obj1 is declared as an object of type A. Therefore, at compile time, there must be a message method in class A or its superclass.
* If the message method in class A is removed, the statement in line 3 will no longer compile.
