# Tech Talk Notes

## Tech Talk 1
### Generics
* We have to create duplicate code for differnet types without genrics.
* Can create objects with generics. Type has to be an object type. Ie: Integer, not int
* Can pass in as parameters. T var
* Good for code reusibility. 
### Linked List
* List which has address for previous values and next values.
* Multiple peices of data is stored in a node.
* Nodes can have the adress of the previous node, the address of the node after and the data that this node contains.
* Memory does not have to be linear.
* Slower to use than a regular list.

* A data structure is a method of organizing data.
* There are many algorithms for different purposes, and they interact with different data structures. Think of algorithms as dynamic underlying pieces that interact with data structures.
* Data Structures and Algorithms can be written using different paradigms.
* An imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform to achieve a result. Imperative programming focuses on describing "how" a program code works.
* Object-Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects.
